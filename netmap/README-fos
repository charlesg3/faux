If you are compiling on Linux 3.0, you cannot use ixgbe as it
has been ported to 3.2.

If you are compiling on Linux 3.2, you cannot use any driver other 
than ixgbe.

You must change your net/Makefile to reflect what modules you want to build 
(e1000 only on 3.0, ixgbe only on 3.2).

Currently only the e1000 driver on Linux 3.0 is working.
